    <h2>Sprints</h2>
    <p>The traditional post-conference sprint, which will be held on Friday, 
      March 11 from 8:00 am to 5:00 pm, is an opportunity for anyone to pitch in
      and help make Drupal better, whether itâ€™s by writing code, reviewing
      patches, developing new modules and themes, or helping improve content and
      documentation on the Drupal.org website. Sprints will be in the Superior,
      Michigan, Erie, Huron and Ontario rooms on the Meeting Room floor.
