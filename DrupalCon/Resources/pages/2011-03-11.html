    <h2>Sprints</h2>

    <p>The traditional post-conference sprint, which will be held on Friday, 
      March 11, is an opportunity for anyone to pitch in and help make Drupal
      better, whether itâ€™s by writing code, reviewing patches, developing new 
      modules and themes, or helping improve content and documentation on the
      Drupal.org website. <span class="sponsor">Sponsored by Microsoft</span>.</p>
