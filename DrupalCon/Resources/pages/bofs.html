<h2>Birds of a Feather</h2>

<p>"Birds of a Feather" sessions are ad-hoc events that anyone can plan. Shortened to "BoF" (pronounced "boff"), these sessions each provide a place for a group of people to share a particular interest. Some Bofs are run as moderated discussions. Some are shared work sessions where everyone brings their computer and helps each other out. Others are more presentation or panel-discussion style. It's really up to whoever is planning the BoF to choose the topic and the format.</p>

<p>This year, all the BoF sessions are being scheduled electronically. To schedule a BoF, or to see what BoFs have already been scheduled, go to the DrupalCon website. The BoF rooms will be open 24 hours a day throughout the entire conference starting Tuesday, March 8 at 11:00 AM and running continuously until Friday, March 12 at 5:00 PM.</p>

<p>There are six rooms on the Meeting Room level for the BoFs. Three rooms have round tables and whiteboards, with a total capacity of around 50 people. More than one BoF session can happen at the same time in these rooms. Three additional rooms are setup classroom-style with projectors and large sticky-pads and a capacity of around 30 people. They each can only hold one session at a time.</p>

<p>With 54 hours of BoF timeslots and up to 15 BoFs happening at the same time, there is a lot of potential BoF activity! Don't miss this key part of DrupalCon.</p>

<p>Want to plan an all-night film festival? Interested in creating a gathering of people in your specific industry? Want to start a fan club for your favorite module? With so many rooms available for so many hours, no topic or interest is too narrow. The options are unlimited. Anyone can schedule a session. And anyone can attend. BoFs are what YOU make of them and if there is one thing we can always rely on, it is that the Drupal community never disappoints.</p>
